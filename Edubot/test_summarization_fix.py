The SDLC framework defines a series of phases that software must go through from conception to deployment and maintenance. The primary phases include planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase has specific objectives, deliverables, and activities that contribute to the overall success of the software project. Planning involves defining the scope, objectives, and resources required for the project. Analysis focuses on understanding user requirements and system specifications. Design phase creates the architectural blueprint and user interface mockups. Implementation involves actual coding and development of the software. Testing ensures the software meets quality standards and user requirements. Deployment involves releasing the software to the production environment. Maintenance includes ongoing support, updates, and bug fixes. Various SDLC models exist including Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and DevOps, each with its own advantages and use cases. The choice of SDLC model depends on factors such as project complexity, team size, timeline, and client requirements. Effective SDLC implementation leads to successful software delivery that meets user expectations and business objectives.",
