        Software is developed or engineered, it is not manufactured in the classical sense. 
        Hardware exhibits relatively high failure rates early in its life, failure rate rises 
        again as hardware components suffer from cumulative effects of dust, vibration, abuse, 
        temperature extremes, and many other environmental maladies. Software costs are 
        concentrated in engineering; software projects cannot be managed as if they were 
        manufacturing projects. A software engineer's job is to make a computer program that 
        performs the functions of a program or version version version version version n s gra nn s h ---.ni n,n ...
